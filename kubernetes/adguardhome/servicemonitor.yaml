    # Obviously, `domain` label will cause high cardinality metrics to be ingested.
    # There's no workaround because full domain names are actually very useful information
    # In most cases, we are only interested in the subdomains prepended to [public suffixes](https://publicsuffix.org/).
    # But that's not something we can implement in regex.
    # Now let's aggregate all the second level domains to another label.
    # This label helps consolidate metrics sourced from the same tracker that uses multiple subdomains (e.g.: <random-string-bs>.siteintercept.qualtrics.com)
    # This will fail for domains like co.uk, com.cn...etc
